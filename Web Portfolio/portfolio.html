           Java Based Pet Game:
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Virtual pets are created which the user must look after, there are no limits as to how many pets you have or what they are.
            The user is allowed to name their pet and their species. A random happiness and hunger level is then generated for the pet, and its 
            the players goal to make sure the pet doesnt go multiple rounds without getting petted or fed - which increases their happiness or hunger level.
            If multiple pets are crated, user is given a choice every round to choose which pet they wish to look after. 
            The only way to win is to go 10 rounds without the pets hunger or hapiness level being ignored for more than 3 rounds.
        </p>

           Unity Based Game:
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Part of my A-Levels coursework, was tasked with creating a game on unity by using the language C#. Game revolves around the user 
            controlling a fox character running on an endless platform killing monsters and farming points from each kill - which can then be used to 
            upgrade the character. Different character models were used to display the users input, backgrounds and platforms were randomly generated 
            to create an endless feeling, enemies were randomly spawned in different locations on screen.
